# SIG Competitive Programming (SIG CP)

Welcome to the SIG CP repository! This repository contains solutions and documentation for various tasks related to competitive programming, data structures, and algorithms. Below are the tasks that need to be completed.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Bit Manipulation Questions (LeetCode Top Interview 150)
- *Objective*: Solve all the Bit Manipulation questions from the [LeetCode Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/).
- *Language*: You may use any programming language of your choice.
- *Documentation*: Ensure that each solution is documented, explaining the approach and logic behind your code.
- *Submission*: Add the solutions to the Task1-BitManipulation folder in this repository, along with the corresponding explanation files.

### Task 2: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (HackerRank Challenges)
- *Objective*: Complete all the basic DSA challenges available at [HackerRank DSA Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/dsa-1726491562).

- *Documentation*: Make sure to explain your approach and solutions. Add them to the Task2-DSA folder, with proper comments and detailed documentation.
- *Submission*: Submit the solutions and explanations in the Task2-DSA folder.

### Task 3: Doubly Linked List Implementation
- *Objective*: Implement a doubly linked list with the following functionalities:
  - Insertion (at the beginning, end, and a specific position)
  - Deletion (from the beginning, end, and a specific position)
  - Traversal (forward and backward)
- *Language*: You may use any programming language of your choice.
- *Documentation*: Ensure to document your code and explain the operations in a separate markdown file.
- *Submission*: Add the implementation and documentation to the Task3-DoublyLinkedList folder.

## Contribution Guidelines

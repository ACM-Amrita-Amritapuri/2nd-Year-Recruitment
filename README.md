## Some reminders...

- *Google is going to be a very dear friend, not only for these tasks but throughout your career, so it's best to learn how to efficiently Google*
- *These tasks are for you to explore the wide world of Computer Science and not just a "Get it over with..." task list. Explore what areas capture your interest*
- *Don't try and cheat, for your own good, it just defeats the purpose*
- *We are always here to help you, just contact us. You might not get a direct answer, but you will absolutely be pointed in the right direction*

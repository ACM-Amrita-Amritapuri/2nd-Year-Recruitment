# Basic Web Security

## Labs

Complete the following labs and upload the screenshots:

- [Set-1](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)
- [Set-2](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting)
- [Set-3](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf)

## Secure Code Review

Use the knowledge gained from the labs to perform a secure code review on a given piece of software (e.g., a small web application).

**Tasks:**

- Identify security issues in the code, such as improper input validation, insecure data storage, and insufficient error handling.
- Provide a detailed report with recommendations for fixing the identified issues.

# Cryptography

## Broadcasts are Bad ðŸ˜‰

Plain RSA was too easy apparently. Try this variation of RSA. (A guy just told me that the Chinese are too smart XD) - [Challenge LinL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r-McAZ7gaQHw2GqPazU7nh98Nyyb4Zic/view)

## Crack the Code

Bob is facing a new challenge involving deciphering a message to obtain the cipher text. The cipher text he needs to find has exactly 28 letters. Here are some crucial clues to get started:

- The first two letters of the cipher text are 'HL'.
- The last two letters of the cipher text are 'BW'.
- A mysterious grid is provided as part of the challenge.

# Forensics

## What is There Inside the File?

Do not use tools to crack; use a script to crack the given zip file. - [Challenge Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5CGqU7WYjRARRk4tqr6H5GkdKrd32nE/view)

## Serene Escape ðŸŒŠ

One of our members has found a place so serene that they practically live there. Your mission is to uncover the name of the dam associated with this tranquil reservoir. - [Challenge Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1js-z3R6gugEtQSDT0e_Jskt9vibATSbU/view)

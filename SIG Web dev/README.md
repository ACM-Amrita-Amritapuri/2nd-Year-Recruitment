ðŸš€ **Calling all S4 coders!** ðŸš€ The ACM Web Team is excited to announce our entrance challenge, designed to test your full-stack web development skills and unleash your creativity. 

## **Choose Your Adventure:**

We've got two exciting theme options to inspire your website:

**1. Time Capsule Traveler:**

* **Theme:** Build a website where users can create personalized time capsules.
* **Features:**
    * User accounts for secure storage.
    * Ability to add text, photos, videos, and voice recordings.
    * Option to specify a future date for "opening" the capsule.
    * Countdown timer to build anticipation! (Optional)

  <h3 align="center">OR</h3>
</p>

**2. Steampunk Sojourn:**

* **Theme:** Craft a website with a steampunk aesthetic, featuring a captivating 3D parallax cityscape that comes alive as users scroll. 
* **Features:**
    * Implement a 3D parallax effect using a JavaScript library like Three.js or Babylon.js. (For an extra challenge, build it from scratch!)
    * Design a steampunk-inspired user interface with gears, rivets, and other thematic elements.
    * Consider incorporating interactive elements that complement the theme (e.g., animated steam vents, moving cogs).

## **The Challenge:**

No matter which theme you choose, your website must:

* Be built using a JavaScript framework you're comfortable with (React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.).
* Integrate with an external API of your choice. This could be a cloud storage service for user uploads (like Imgur or Cloudinary) or a date/time API.
* Include a functional backend server to handle user authentication, data storage, and API communication. Choose your weapon - Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP (Laravel), or any other backend framework you prefer.

## **What We're Looking For:**

* **Full-Stack Mastery:**  Demonstrate your grasp of front-end development, API integration, and backend development. 
* **Creative Execution:** Impress us with a website that embodies your chosen theme, whether it's a user-friendly time capsule app or an immersive steampunk world.
* **Technical Proficiency:** Showcase your ability to overcome challenges and deliver a well-functioning website. 

## **Timeline:**

* Submission Deadline: TBD

## **Show Us What You've Got!**

This is your chance to showcase your full-stack web development skills and join the ranks of the ACM Web Team. We're eager to see the innovative and dynamic websites you create!

## **Additional Notes:**

* Document your code clearly and provide a well-written README file explaining your approach for both the front-end and back-end components.
* Be prepared to present your website and explain your development choices during a short interview.
